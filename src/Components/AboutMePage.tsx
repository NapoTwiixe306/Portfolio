      <p>
        My name is Julien, soon to be 21 years old (on May 3rd), and I am a self-taught web developer. I have a strong command of 
        several programming languages such as HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, Python, and Java, as well as frameworks like MongoDB, React.js, and Vue.js. I acquired all these skills as an autodidact,
        as I am passionate about coding and computer science. In addition to developing web projects, I also enjoy solving complex computer problems. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with friends
        and soaking up the sun. And lastly, a fun fact about me is that I can solve a Rubik's Cube in less than 20 seconds (no joke).
